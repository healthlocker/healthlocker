# Healthlocker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/healthlocker/healthlocker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/healthlocker/healthlocker)
[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/healthlocker/healthlocker/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/healthlocker/healthlocker?branch=master)

## Getting started

### Install the following:
* [Elixir](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir#how)
* [Postgresql](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-postgresql) (and ensure you create a user)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Once everything is installed:
* Enter `brew link autoconf automake` into your terminal
* Open Postgresql (if you can see the elephant symbol in your menu bar you know that it's running)
* Get dependencies (including if they are out of date) with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
* There is seed data which can be inserted into your dev database by running
`mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`. Note: you can see this data in
[the seeds.exs file](priv/repo/seeds.exs).
* If prompted by the following message, enter `y`:

` Could not find "rebar3", which is needed to build dependency :fs
I can install a local copy which is just used by Mix
Shall I install rebar3? (if running non-interactively, use: "mix local.rebar --force") [Yn] `
* Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## How?

### Updating select input options

The options for `hours_slept`, `wake_count` and `security_questions` can be
updated by editing the corresponding `.txt` file. Go to the file(s) that you
want to edit for  
[hours_slept](web/static/assets/hours_slept.txt),
[wake_count](web/static/assets/wake_count.txt), or
[security_questions](web/static/assets/security_questions.txt) and follow
through the instructions below.

Click on the pencil in the top right corner of the file.
![edit-file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1287388/24212494/74f767d0-0f27-11e7-95b8-2b3bff21cbc5.png)

Make any changes you wish to the file. Delete questions, change the wording,
or add new ones. The only thing to keep in mind for this is to put each question
in the file on it's own line. Do not use commas or anything besides a new line
to separate questions.

```
Option 1
Option 2
Option 3
```

After you are done making changes, you can find a box underneath the file that
says `Commit changes`.

![commit-changes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1287388/24213604/fb238f2a-0f2a-11e7-8a60-251e40e3251c.png)

In here, you can write a short message in the box that says `Update` describing
the change e.g. Add new option, Reword security question, etc.

Ensure the bottom option ("*Create a new branch for this commit and start a
pull request.*") is ticked as in the image above.

Click on `Propose file change`.

You will be taken to a new page where you can create a pull request. You can
leave the default text as the title, and reference any related issues in the
comment box.

Click `Create pull request` in the bottom right.

![create-pr](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1287388/24213909/e2c6164a-0f2b-11e7-8ccf-d3f206108488.png)

If you are happy with the changes, change the label to `awaiting-review`:

![awaiting-review](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1287388/24214001/21fe0ac0-0f2c-11e7-96a5-8f58110637c5.png)

Then add a `Reviewer` and `Assignee` of your choice.

The options for `hours_slept` and `wake_count` can be updated in the same way.
Go to the files for [hours_slept](web/static/assets/hours_slept.txt) or
[wake_count](web/static/assets/wake_count.txt), and follow through the
instructions above.

### Writing tips & stories

The stories and tips can be written using markdown. This will allow you to
style the text as you write it.

You can find a
[guide to common things you may want to do with markdown](markdown-syntax.md)
in this repository.

In addition to formatting the text with markdown, be sure to include `#story`
or `#tip` (with an additional *category* tag) so the story or tip displays on
the page.
