## Getting started

#### Install the following:
* [Elixir](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir#how)
* [Postgresql](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-postgresql) (and ensure you create a user)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Once everything is installed:
* Enter `brew link autoconf automake` into your terminal
* Open Postgresql (if you can see the elephant symbol in your menu bar you know that it's running)
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
* If prompted by the following message, enter `y`:

` Could not find "rebar3", which is needed to build dependency :fs
I can install a local copy which is just used by Mix
Shall I install rebar3? (if running non-interactively, use: "mix local.rebar --force") [Yn] `
* Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
