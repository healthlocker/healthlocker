    <p class="b">A diary can be used in lots of ways.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul class="i">
      <li>as a record of experiences, thoughts, emotions or reflections</li>
      <li>as a diary of alcohol or drug use</li>
      <li>alongside a sleep or problem tracker to note any choices we make, people we spend time with or places we go that make our mental health better or worse</li>
      <input type="checkbox" id="diary-ways-read-more" class="dn">
      <label for="diary-ways-read-more" class="diary-ways-read-more-read-more hl-aqua underline">[Read more]</label>
      <div class="diary-ways-read-more-div dn">
        <li>to notice what was happening just before a problem started or got worse, and what happened afterwards</li>
        <li>somewhere to write about important moments in life, now or in the past</li>
        <li>as a place to reflect on our past or current relationships, to notice any helpful or unhelpful patterns</li>
        <li>a space to write about things you are thankful for, sometimes called a ‘gratitude diary’.</li>
