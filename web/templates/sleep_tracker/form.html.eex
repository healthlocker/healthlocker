    <p>
      Good sleep helps promote both mental and physical wellbeing.
      Here are some ideas to try.
    </p>

    <div class="tc">
      <%= img_tag("/images/Toolkit_sleep.png", class: "w4") %>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Ensure you go outside in natural daylight every day and try
      regular exercise</strong><br>This can regulate your internal body clock and
      help you concentrate, sleep, look and feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Avoid daytime napping even if you have not slept well the night
      before</strong><br>If you have to have a nap, limit it to 20 minutes and
      avoid napping after 5pm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Avoid caffeine, nicotine and alcohol 4 hours before bed and avoid
      late meals or snacking</strong><br>These can all be stimulating for your
      body and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Avoid using your phone, iPad or laptop an hour before going to
      bed, and avoid using them in bed. Remove digital distractions like TV
      from your bedroom.</strong><br>The backlight on devices suppresses melatonin
      - the hormone that helps you sleep. If you do need to use them change
      the display settings to reduce the brightness (blue light exposure).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Take a warm bath or shower at least an hour before bedtime</strong>
      <br>The rise and fall in body temperature supports the release of sleep
      enhancing hormone melatonin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Do some gentle stretching or
        <%= link_to("progressive muscle relaxation",
        to: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x3tl81NW3w", target: "_blank") %>
      </strong><br>
      This will encourage your whole body to relax and help you sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Have pen and paper by your bed to jot down worrying thoughts or
      ideas</strong><br>This may help stop you going over and over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you canâ€™t sleep within 15 minutes of going to bed -
      stop trying: go to another room or sit in a chair and read a book.
      Return to bed when you feel sleepy again</strong><br>
      This will strengthen the association of bed with sleep rather
      than being awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try the Mindfulness course at the
      <%= link_to("Recovery College",
      to: "http://www.slamrecoverycollege.co.uk/courses.html",
      target: "_blank") %></strong><br>
      Mindfulness has been shown to improve our emotional regulation, which
      can help sleep.
