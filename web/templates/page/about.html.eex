  <p class="b">What is Healthlocker?</p>

  <p>Healthlocker is a secure platform powered by the
    <a href="http://www.slam.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">South London and Maudsley Trust</a>
    that promotes supported self-management and opportunities to improve
    communication between service users, carers and clinicians.</p>

  <p class="b">It is currently in development and this is the Beta version. More features
    and improvements will be added in the coming months.</p>

  <p class="b">Who is Healthlocker for?</p>

  <p>Anyone can <%= link "sign up to Healthlocker", to: user_path(@conn, :new) %>
    to explore wellbeing tips and recovery stories and create goals and coping
    strategies.</p>

  <p>If you are a South London and Maudsley (SLaM) service user, you can choose
    to connect your Healthlocker account with your SLaM health record and care
    team. Soon you will be able to communicate with your care team and access
    your care plan, to interact with your goals and coping strategies.</p>

  <p>If you are a close family member, friend or carer of someone at SLaM, soon
    you will be able to sign up and connect with their care team so that you can
    let them know how the person you support is doing.</p>

  <p>If you are staff at SLaM, you can access Healthlocker via the icon in the
    top panel in ePJS. Soon you will be able to share information, resources
    and messages with service users and their carers and view updates that your
    caseload has chosen to share with you.</p>

  <p>Healthlocker is powered by South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust
    (SLaM), if you are interested in using Healthlocker in your Trust or
    organisation, contact:
    <a href="mailto:DigitalServices@slam.nhs.uk">DigitalServices@slam.nhs.uk</a></p>

  <p class="b">Why Healthlocker?</p>

  <p>Healthlocker aims to demonstrate how personalised health records (PHRs)
    could enhance NHS service delivery and support people to stay well.</p>

  <p class="b">How does it work / what next?</p>

  <p>Healthlocker is built using agile development processes which enables
    iteration through user-centred build, test and learn cycles.</p>

  <p>Healthlocker integrates with SLaMs clinical record system (ePJS), meaning
    that service users are able to access and interact with their care plan.</p>

  <p>The platform will be built open source and in a modular way that allows for
    future integrations. Healthlocker will continue to grow and develop.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in using Healthlocker in your Trust or organisation
    or have ideas for how to add to the platform, contact:
