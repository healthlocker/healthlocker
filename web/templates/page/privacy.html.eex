  <p class="b">Introduction</p>
  <p>
    We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. The following
    Privacy Statement applies to Healthlocker in its entirety, and sets out how
    your personal data is handled by us. We strongly recommend that you take
    some time to read this policy carefully to understand how we treat your
    personal data.
  </p>

  <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
  <p class="b">Information you provide</p>
  <p>
    We collect information directly from you in a number of ways. You have a
    choice about the data we collect.  When you are asked to provide data, you
    may decline.  However, some information will need to be provided in order
    to have a Healthlocker account. This will include your email and password.
  </p>

  <p>
    Healthlocker also uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that save and
    retrieve information about your visit, such as how you entered and
    navigated the app and what information was of interest to you. In addition
    to this, if you personalise any part of Healthlocker, the information is
    stored in a cookie and is remembered for your next visit. Cookies provide
    an anonymised label for each user. If you are uncomfortable with the use of
    cookies, you can disable cookies on your electronic device by changing the
    settings in the 'Preferences' or 'Options' menu in your internet browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data may be collected when you enter information as part of your
    Healthlocker Personal Record. When this data is collected, we will notify
    you as to why we are asking you for this information, and how this
    information will be used. It is completely up to you whether or not you
    provide it, and if you do not feel comfortable providing this information,
    you are under no obligation to do so. Healthlocker uses a temporary session
    cookie to reference the active server session. The cookie is in-memory
    only and is not active after the browser session is closed.
  </p>

  <p class="b">Networks and Devices</p>
  <p>
    When you access Healthlocker, we use technology to collect information
    indirectly, such as your internet address (IP Address), which is then kept
    in our internet logs. This is collected for aggregate information purposes
    and represents statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and
    patterns. This data does not identify any individual in any way and is
    anonymised.
  </p>
