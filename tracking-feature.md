# Inputting and viewing tracking data

Tracking data is an important part of Healthlocker for both the service user
and the clinician.

Service users can use the tracking features as a way to self
monitor their progress in areas that are important to them. They can use some
or all of the trackers depending on the personal value.

Clinicians can use this as a tool to see changes (improvements or declines)
for their patients over time.

Users are able to track:
* [Sleep](https://www.healthlocker.uk/sleep-tracker/new)
  * How long they slept
  * How many times they woke up
  * Notes about their sleep

* [Custom tracker](https://www.healthlocker.uk/symptom/new)
  * User can enter a custom problem that is relevant to them

  * Once they have entered a custom problem title, they can [track the problem daily](https://www.healthlocker.uk/symptom-tracker/new)
    * how much this problem affected them for that day
    * notes for the problem for that days

All of the sections to input tracking information can be found in the
[goals and tracking section](https://www.healthlocker.uk/toolkit) for logged
in users.

Once tracking data has been entered, all of it can be viewed in the [tracking overview](https://www.healthlocker.uk/tracking-overview)

This includes a graph, where you can toggle to see hours slept or the problem
scale.

It also has other details entered by the user when tracking (notes, diary
entries) underneath the graph.

The clinician has the same view of the tracking overview in their caseload for
patients who have chosen to connect their Healthlocker account with their NHS
health record.
